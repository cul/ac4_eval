<h1>Copyright Information</h1>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-12 .col-sm-6 col-lg-8">
<p>Works in Academic Commons are protected by copyright, with all rights
 reserved, unless otherwise indicated. The copyright for any work 
included in Academic Commons is retained by the copyright owner. 
Academic Commons does not own copyrights.</p>

<p>Works are made available in Academic Commons at the direction of 
contributors (an author/creator or originating department, center, 
program, or school at Columbia or its affiliates) according to their 
understanding of their rights in that material. Works are added to 
Academic Commons when contributors affirm that they own the rights or 
have authority to contribute the works. Columbia University makes no 
representation or warranty about the appropriateness of the contribution
 or whether the contributor continues to own rights in the works.</p>
 <p>Users of Academic Commons are 
responsible for determining whether a work is protected by copyright, 
the identity of the copyright owner, and the means for appropriately 
using the work. (You can view our Terms of Use <a href="">here</a>.)</p>

<h2>Determining Appropriate Use of Works in Academic Commons</h2>
<p>The information below may help you address copyright questions about 
the appropriate use of works found in the Academic Commons collections. 
Please note that this guidance is not legal advice, nor does it address 
other relevant legal issues. By providing it, we do not intend to set 
restrictions, but instead to offer helpful insights about copyright and 
about contacting the proper party for permission, as needed.</p>
<h3>Fair Use</h3>
<p>Fair Use offers an extraordinarily important opportunity for 
educators, researchers, and others to make reasonable and limited uses 
of copyrighted materials. It is your responsibility to determine if your
 planned use of works found in Academic Commons is consistent with Fair 
Use. To learn more, see the <a href="https://copyright.columbia.edu/basics/fair-use.html">Fair Use</a> section of the Columbia University Copyright Advisory Office website.</p>
<h3>Licensed Uses</h3>
<p>If a work in Academic Commons includes a license or other statement with information about how the work can be used (e.g. <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>),
 users may use the work in ways consistent with the license. This 
information may appear in the metadata record for the work or in the 
work itself. Be sure to look for specific conditions and any suggestions
 for citation or attribution. Users desiring to utilize the work beyond 
the terms of the license should contact the copyright owner.</p>
<h3>Finding the Copyright Owner</h3>
<p>Authors/creators of many works in Academic Commons own the copyright
 to the work unless they have transferred rights to another party. Users
 seeking to locate the copyright owner of a work in Academic Commons 
could begin by contacting the author/creator of the work.</p>
<p>Many works in Academic Commons have been published, either before or 
after the work has been deposited in Academic Commons. In some of these 
cases, the authors/creators have transferred the copyright to a 
publisher. To contact the copyright owner of published works 
(especially those works that are not published under an open access 
license), users could begin by contacting the publisher.</p>
<h3>Columbia as Copyright Holder</h3>
<p>Columbia University does not own a copyright interest solely because the work is available in Academic Commons. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Users
 do not need to contact Columbia University for permission solely 
because the work is available in Academic Commons. When Columbia 
University is not the rights owner, it will neither grant nor deny 
copyright permission regarding such materials.</li>

<li>If a user 
determines that Columbia University may be the copyright owner of a 
work and needs to contact the copyright owner, please start by 
contacting the person or office at Columbia that was responsible for 
creating the work. (See Videos of Speakers, below, for an example.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Special Cases</h2>
<h3>Data and Datasets</h3>
<p>In general, facts and collections of facts do not have copyright 
protection under U.S. copyright law. However, some data and data 
collections may have sufficient originality to be copyrightable. Users 
of data found in Academic Commons are responsible for determining any 
legal protection associated with the materials and reviewing any 
statements from the contributor about appropriate uses.</p>
<h3>Videos of Speakers</h3>
<p>Academic Commons includes videos, many of guest speakers at Columbia 
University events. For many such videos, rights in the visual images are
 owned by Columbia University, while the words and other content are the 
work of the speaker and rights may be retained by the speaker. Users may
 need to contact the speaker, and the office at Columbia that created 
the video, for further information.</p>

<p>If you believe that you are the copyright owner of a work that is improperly included in Academic Commons, you may submit a notice of copyright infringement using the form here: <a href="">http://academiccommons.columbia.edu/copyright_infringement_notice</a>.</p>
